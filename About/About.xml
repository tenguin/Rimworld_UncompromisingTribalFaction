The tribal faction is in a sorry state. In a world with either gun-toting, high tech, robotic, armored, or giant insect factions, it's a wonder the tribal faction has managed to survive at all.

After losing battle after battle, the chiefs got together to formulate a new battle strategy.

New Tribal War Plan:
1. Gives tribal Breachers and Berserkers a 50% chance to spawn with volcanic ash filled "Smoke bombs", to cover their advance amidst gunfire.
2. Gives tribal Heavy Archers and Archer Chiefs "Fire bows", to ignite colonists and colonies from great range.
3. Adds the tribal Fire thrower, a grenadier unit equipped with "Fire bombs" from "Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Tribal", to flush out defenders from their positions.
4. Gives tribal Breachers, Berserkers, and Chiefs "Battle banners" from "Vanilla Apparel Expanded - Accessories", to increase their pain threshold.
5. Gives all tribal Archers "Quivers" from "Vanilla Apparel Expanded - Accessories", to increase their ranged rate of fire.
6. Gives tribal Breachers, Archers, and Warriors normal quality gear instead of poor quality.
7. Tweaked raid unit spawn ratios for more effective battle groups.

New Item: Smoke Bomb 
  A small clay pot filled with fine volcanic ash. When smashed mid-air, it will release a small cloud of smoke, obscuring incoming shots and preventing turrets from locking on.
  Cost: 20 Stone bricks
  Cannot be refilled (2 charges)
  Smaller radius than smokepop belts

New Item: Fire Bow
  A greatbow equipped with flaming arrows, which excels at dislodging defenders by setting them on fire. However, it takes a fair bit longer to ignite each arrow before firing it.
  Cost: 60 Wood, 40 Chemfuel
  Lower rate of fire and damage
  Sets enemies and terrain on fire

The goal of this mod was to make the tribals a proper and decent enemy faction, having their own strengths and requiring some strategy to take down, but not overpowered. Hope you enjoy!
