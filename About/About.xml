The tribal faction is in a sorry state. In a world with either gun-toting, high tech, robotic, armored, or giant insect factions, it's a wonder the tribal faction has managed to survive at all.
The goal of this mod was to make the tribals into an actual threat, having their own strengths and requiring some strategy to take down, but not overpowered. Please leave balance suggestions if you find them too strong or weak!

New Tribal War Plan:
1. Adds the Flame thrower, a grenadier unit equipped with "Molotov Cocktails" to flush out defenders from their positions.
2. Gives Breachers and Berserkers volcanic ash filled "Smoke bombs", to cover their advance amidst gunfire.
3. Gives Hunters, Heavy Archers, and Archer Chiefs modified "Flamebows" and "Great Flamebows", that can ignite both terrain and colonists.
4. Tweaked raid unit ratios for a more effective army composition.

Vanilla Apparel Expanded - Accessories Integration (If optionally installed):
1. Gives tribal Breachers, Berserkers, and Chiefs "Battle banners" from "Vanilla Apparel Expanded - Accessories" (If optionally installed).
2. Gives all tribal Archers "Quivers" from "Vanilla Apparel Expanded - Accessories" (If optionally installed).

New Item: Smoke Bomb (Usable by AI!)
Fine volcanic ash wrapped in a straw bundle. When smashed mid-air, it will release a small cloud of smoke, obscuring incoming shots and preventing turrets from locking on.
Cost: 10 Stone bricks
Cannot be refilled (1 charge)
Smaller radius than smokepop belts

New Item: Great Flamebow
A greatbow equipped with incendiary arrows, which excels at dislodging defenders with its long range and high accuracy.
Can ignite both terrain and colonists.

Modified Item: Flamebow
Biotech's flamebow has been changed from AoE to single tile ignition and made usable by all tribes. Molotovs now fulfill the role of close range AoE fire threat, while the flamebows are meant for medium range high rate of fire.
Graphically upgraded to look cooler and easily distinguishable from standard bows.

New Item: Firebomb
If Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Tribals is installed, Firebombs should be equipped by ~10-15% of tribal units. If not installed, Molotov Cocktails will be equipped instead.
		
Biotech Specific Changes:
The Savage Impid tribe will now use all the tools in this mod, giving them an even more diverse toolkit!
The Rough Neanderthal tribe prefers melee due to their poor shooting skills, so will be majority melee except for a small amount of flame throwers and fire archers.


Compatibility
*0% performance impact (no Harmony patches needed!).

*Safe to add mid-game, not recommended to remove mid-game.

*Independent, isolated, and minimal in scope, with no modifications to vanilla behavior/code required: However XML patches are required to modify units from the vanilla tribal faction, so it may conflict with mods that make large changes to the vanilla tribal faction.

*Confirmed compatible with Combat Extended, Vanilla Expanded series, Alpha series, Dubs series, and hundreds more.

~3.1 Update: Restored the use of Fire bombs if Vanilla Expanded Weapons - Tribals is installed. Will use Molotovs instead if not installed.
~3.0 Update:
~ Now updated for 1.5 Anomaly!
~ Removed dependency on Vanilla Weapons Extended - Tribal. Tribal units changed to use Molotovs instead of Fire Bombs.
~ Changed graphic for the smoke bomb.
~ Slightly increased number of flame thrower units, smoke bomb reduced to 1 charge but 100% spawn rate.
~2.02 update:
- Added compatibility for Combat Extended 1.4!
- Removed dependency on Vanilla Apparel Expanded — Accessories since the battle banners and quivers aren't essential to the functioning of this mod. It is now an optional requirement.
~2.01 update: Reduced smoke bomb spawn chance back to 50%
~2.0 update:
- Now updated for 1.4 and Biotech!
- The Savage Impid tribe will now use all the tools in this mod, making them a powerful threat!
- The Rough Neanderthal tribe fields a very melee heavy force due to their poor shooting skills, so instead of regular archers, the few ranged units they do bring along will entirely be for setting your colony on fire.
- Modified Biotech's Flamebow to only ignite one tile. Fire bombs fulfill the role of the high priority AoE fire threat, while Flamebows are meant for long term sustained harassment. With the new tools available, flamebows also having AoE would be redundant and too powerful.
- Smoke bombs now have a 65% spawn chance up from 50%.
- Smoke bombs will now be visible on the carrier's back.
- Fire bomber spawn chance increased.
- Fire Archers split into Hunters using Flamebow and Heavy Archers using Great Flamebow.
- Fire units had their raid point cost increased.
- CE compatibility will be added when their 1.4 version is released.
~1.1f update: Added conditionals to some xml patches to ensure better compatibility with other mods that modify the vanilla tribal faction.
~1.1e update: Fixed some errors in the CE compatibility patch.
~1.1d update: Decreased Fire bow accuracy by 10% so it's less annoying to deal with. Added compatibility for Combat Shields.
~1.1c update: Shifted part of the Fire bows reload time into its warmup time.
~1.1b update: Prevented Fire bows from spawning in trader, visitor, and traveler groups. Tweaked Fire archer/Fire bomber spawn rates.
~1.1 update: Added Fire Bows! Reduced the spawn rate of Fire bombers to take into account the new Fire archers.
